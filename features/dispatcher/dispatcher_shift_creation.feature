Feature: Dispatcher Shift Creation

  As a dispatcher
  I want to manually create shifts for drivers
  So that I can manage shift assignments efficiently

  Scenario: Dispatcher creates a new shift from calendar
    Given I am on the "Shifts Calendar" page
    Then I should see each day has a button for create a new shift
    When I click one day's "New shift" button
    Then I should be on the "New shift" page
    And the shift date field should show the date of the day I selected
