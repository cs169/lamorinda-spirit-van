Both the passenger and rides tabs are managed through datatables, which resembles an Excel table. The passengers table includes all the passengers in the system and is required for creating a ride, while the rides table includes all the previous ride’s data. Each row displays the fields for a particular passenger or ride as well as the two action buttons (Edit or Delete). 

Here are the features that exist on the Passengers & Rides tab:

### Hide / Show Columns

### Searching and Filtering

Towards the bottom of the table is the search function; Each column has its own search bar which filters all rows, multiple columns can be searched at the same time. For example, if there exists a Passenger named John who lives at 213 Example St, you can quickly narrow it down by searching John in Name, and 213 Example St in Address.

### Sizing and text truncation

Some fields are truncated or cut to prevent their excessive length from bloating the table size, an indicator that a field has been truncated is “...”, and the full text can be seen by hovering over it with the cursor. If you still feel like the cells/rows are too small or big, you can use the default browser shortcuts (CTRL +/-) to adjust the table.
