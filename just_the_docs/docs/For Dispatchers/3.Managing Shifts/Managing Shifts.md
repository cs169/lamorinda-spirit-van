To manage driver schedules, the dispatcher first manually collects driver idle times. These records can then be added to the database for ongoing management.

### View and Manage Shifts 
\
**View All Shifts for a Specific Driver**

To see a complete list of shifts assigned to a particular driver, click on their name (e.g., "Mike") directly on the calendar.

**Manage an Individual Shift (Edit, Delete, Add Notes)**

To modify an existing shift, delete it, or leave a note for the driver associated with it:

Click on the specific shift entry on the calendar (e.g., an "AM" shift). This will open the management options for that shift.

**Available Actions**

##### Edit Shift Details 

Click "Edit this shift" to change the shift's date, assigned driver, or type.

##### Delete Shift: 

Click "Delete this shift" to remove the record. Please note: This operation is irreversible.

##### Return to Calendar 

Click "Back to shifts" to go back to the main Shift Calendar page.
Leave a Note for the Driver:

You can provide important details or instructions for the driver regarding this specific shift using the rich text editor.

This editor supports line breaks (press Enter for a new line). You can also adjust the editor's height by dragging the resize handle (often shown as diagonal lines) located in its bottom-right corner.

After entering your note, click "Save."
The assigned driver will then be able to see the details you've provided when they view their schedule for that corresponding date.
