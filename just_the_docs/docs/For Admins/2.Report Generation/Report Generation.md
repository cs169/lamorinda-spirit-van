### Report Generation

---

On the “Reports” tab:
- Click on the selected query 
- Choose the start date and end date, then click “Apply” to run the query
- After the data appears, click on “Download” if needed

We use Blazer, a tool we added to your website, to create custom data queries and generate reports based on the specific information you’ve requested. It allows us to pull insights directly from the database, such as ride counts and passenger details, and display them in tables and charts. 

Data Queries

- 5310 Report: includes details like senior, disabled, and wheelchair passengers
- Fare by Passengers: shows how much fare passengers have paid over time
- Foundation Report: breakdown of count and proportion of low-income rides
- New Passengers: lists passengers who use the service for the first time 
- Passenger Trips By City: counts how many trips a given passenger, grouped by their home city
- Rides By City: shows how many rides started or ended in a city
- Service Miles per Van (part of 5310 Report): adds up the miles each van drove during shifts
